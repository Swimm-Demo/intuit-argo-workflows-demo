# Introduction to Http1 Client

The Http1 package within the Apiclient directory provides various client functionalities for interacting with different services. This package includes multiple client implementations such as `info-service-client`, `watch-workflows-client`, `server-sent-events-client`, and `workflow-service-client`.

# Facade Struct

The <SwmToken path="pkg/apiclient/http1/archived-workflows-service-client.go" pos="13:6:6" line-data="type ArchivedWorkflowsServiceClient = Facade">`Facade`</SwmToken> struct encapsulates common HTTP operations like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, making it easier to interact with RESTful APIs.

# Server-Sent Events Client

The `serverSentEventsClient` struct is designed to handle Server-Sent Events (SSE), providing a consistent way to receive real-time updates from the server.

# Specialized Clients

The package also includes specialized clients for handling events and logs, such as `eventWatchClient` and `podLogsClient`, which facilitate streaming and monitoring of workflow-related events and logs.

# HTTPHeader

HTTPHeader describes a custom header to be used in HTTP probes.

# Http1 Endpoints

The Http1 package defines various endpoints for interacting with different services.
