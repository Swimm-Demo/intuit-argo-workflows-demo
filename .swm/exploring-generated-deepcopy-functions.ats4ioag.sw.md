Generated <SwmToken path="pkg/apis/workflow/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go" pos="2972:2:2" line-data="// DeepCopy is an autogenerated deepcopy function, copying the receiver, creating a new Submit.">`DeepCopy`</SwmToken> functions are autogenerated methods used to create deep copies of objects. These functions ensure that a new instance of an object is created with the same data as the original, but without any references to the original object.
