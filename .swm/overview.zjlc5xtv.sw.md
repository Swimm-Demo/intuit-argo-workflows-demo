title: Overview

The repository 'intuit-argo-workflows-demo' is focused on Argo Workflows, an open-source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. It allows users to define workflows where each step is a container and supports modeling multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### User Interface

The User Interface (UI) is the visual component of the application that allows users to interact with the system. It includes elements like forms, buttons, and displays that facilitate user input and provide feedback. The UI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily navigate and perform tasks within the application.
